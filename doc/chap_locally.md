### Important about selecting period
If your primary goal is to predict the number of cases (rather than to evaluate models), make sure you select the most recent completed period up to today. CHAP Core does not account for specific dates and treats each month's registrations equally. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the data you provide is complete. For example, if today's date is the 15th, the data for the current month is likely to be incomplete because it won't include information from the second half of the month. CHAP Core is not able to tell that the data belongs to an incomplete month and will count it as one full month of registration when it in reality is only 15 days. This will cause inaccurate predictions.
